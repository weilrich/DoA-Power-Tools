Version: 07032011i

Attack
07012011a Attack bug: found that scanMapBusy was being set to true when dat.done in butSearchNow(). Fixed
07012011a Attack feature: Added 'Clear' button and checkbox to allow users to clear the last attacked field in the target list. This allows the user to start at the top of the list again rather than wherever they last left off.
07012011a Attack bug: mapObject array had information in it when map is transferred causing some wrong map types to exist in the target list. I zero the array length before copying the new target list in butTransfer(). Fixed
07022011a Attack feature (private build only): Append alliance name to city/outpost target list
07032011f Attack bug: selected map name was set to 'Anthropus Camp' but was being checked as 'AntCamp' causing the radio button to never be selected. Fixed
07032011g Attack bug: butSearch did not transfer the map to the target. Fixed
07042011c Attack bug: troopsChanged would not allow more than 100000 troops to be sent at once. Changed to 120000. Fixed

Train
07012011a Training feature: added third outpost and Firetroops. Guessed at new troop name: Djinn - will replace when I see what the actual name is
07012011a Training bug: Stonetroop (and Firetroop) training not supported through checkReqs. Will add when I can build them.
07032011i Training feature: Added a check for queue space before calling runJob to lighten the load on the server and reduce/eliminate turning auto-train off because of errors
07042011b Jobs now created as city "sets". A set will run if the city has enough queue space for all the troops in the job. For example, if you are training bds, lbms, minos, and ats the set is four troops and will be queued as soon as the city has 4 empty queue slots. It does waste some queue slots, but it prevents runaway training of a few troops. A better way would be to create job sets based on the number of queue slots available. In this case if you have 10 slots available and four troop types training the LCM would be 4*5*3 (60), 60/10 slots gives 6 jobs before the jobs repeat: 
job1: bd, lbm, mino, at 
job2: bd, lbm, mino, at
job3: bd, lbm (queue full)
job4: mino, at, bd, lbm
job5: mino, at, bd, lbm
job7: mino, at
TBD: show individual time for completion in status with total time next to city name

Auto-Collect
07042011b Was generating server errors spuriously because 'p' was not declared as a var before it was used. Fixed.

Build
07042011c caps show current lowest levels unless the user sets them otherwise
TBD: allow building to continue for jobs that have not reached their caps. As it is now, auto-build stops as soon as any cap is reached

Research
07032011a Implemented basic auto-research using research caps.
07032011i Research bug: says 'Nothing to do, disabling auto-build' - should say 'Nothing to do, disabling auto-research'. Fixed
07032011i Research bug: after submitting the research job, auto-research turns itself off. Fixed
07042011c caps show current levels unless the user sets them otherwise

Other
07012011a Added initializer to defaults for ptWinPos.
07032011i Changed setTimeout to setInterval in Research, Build, and Training - this will propagate to the rest of the code base over time
07042011c Added variable declarations to readMergeOptions to eliminate possible scope conflicts
